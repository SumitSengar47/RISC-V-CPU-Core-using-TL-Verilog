# RISC-V-CPU-Core-Using-TL-Verilog
This repository contains the complete work developed during the "Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours (MYTH)" Workshop, organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) in collaboration with Redwood EDA. In just five days, we explored the fundamentals of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and implemented a fully functional RV32I-based pipelined RISC-V CPU core using Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog).

The project is developed on the [Makerchip IDE](https://www.makerchip.com/) ,a browser-based platform designed for hardware modeling and simulation using [TL-Verilog](https://tl-x.org/). Alongside the CPU design, this repository also includes simple test programs written in C, Assembly, and pseudocode to validate the coreâ€™s functionality.

This workshop offers a practical and accelerated path into computer architecture and digital design, ideal for students, enthusiasts, and budding VLSI engineers.
